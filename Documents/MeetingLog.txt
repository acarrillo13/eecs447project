Work done during meeting:
1. Worked collaboratively on the diagram for project 3 where Alex shared the screen and we walked through the diagrams making edits, the ER diagram was done in drawio, the file itself is in documentation
2. The idea of a digital ticket was agreed by all. When a patron checks out the book or an item from the library a ticket will be issued (digitally) that flags that they have checked the book out. Incase of return, we can close the ticket.
3. We are assuming the library is open and free resources for all.
4. Unique IDs for Digital media File types for digital media
5. Documentation for submission

1. Introduction - Micheal Buckedahl, Astha Thapa 
2. Relational Schema mapping - Kyle Moore, Shravya Matta
3. Relational Schema Diagram - Alexander Carrillo
4. Schema Documentation - Beck Malinowski

Work done/ Task Accomplished in the meeting : 
1. We worked collaboratively to define the niche structure of our database tables which included adding the attributes, working on to find the primary keys as well as the foreign keys and also brushing up our functional dependencies for the project.
2. While all of the team members were present in the meeting, Alex like always shared the screen and walked us through the diagram.
3. Additionally, Alex also shared the google document with the rest of the team where all of us worked collaboratively for the documentation.
4. We worked on the diagram to add the relations, attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys (for the relational schema diagram)
5.Alex worked on the relational Schema diagram whereas Michael worked on the table while Michael also helped in finding the foreign keys for the team.
6. One of the cocnerns/ questions brought up in the meeting was about the unique ids that we have planned to assign each book in the database even though they may be identical, have the same authors and is the same book but just multiple in numbers. We all agreed upon the idea that no matter how identical a book is to the other, we stand firm with the idea of assigning a unique/ distinct identification number for the book. For instance, if I check out the book 'The Great Gatsby' by F. Scott Fitzgerald (two of the same books), despite the books being the same, each of the two books will have unique id.
7.Two books could have the same authors and same publication but we are assigning the books unique ids so that they can be distinct and recognized
8. Documentation for submission.

Work done/ Task Accomplished in the meeting :

2. Through out this brief meeting, each of the team member reviewed the work, had a discussion about some specifics of the project that needed immediate attention, and when everything was polished, we all agreed to submit project part 5 that is due tonight.
3. We had a conversation that after one of the group members had a 1-1 conversation with Dr. Hossein, we got suggested that we do not need to specify any particular site to run our project but just need to mention that we ran it in SQL. All of the team members agreed to that.
4. We briefly went over the tables we created to check if they needed any changes. All of the group members agreed that it is ready to be posted.
5. We discussed about the database that has been created by the team and worked to make sure that the directory is actually available on github and on the google document ready to be posted. After accomplishing that, everyone agreed to end the meeting and have the work posted on canvas.
